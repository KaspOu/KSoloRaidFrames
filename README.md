# K Solo Raid Frames

**Always show Raid frames**

I suggest you to use Raid-Style Party Frames
(In Edit Mode, select the Party Frames, you will see the option)

Commands:
**/sr** will show status of solo raid frames
**/sr edit** to access edit mode and party frames options



If you are looking for more options, I recommend you **Kallye Raid Frames**
